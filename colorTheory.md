## Color Schemes

### Monochromatic

* Single color, variying shades and tints
* Looks clean and polished
* Used for charts and graphs where high contrast isn't required

### Analogous

* Pairs one main color with adjacent colors
* Comes in 3 and 5 color schemes
* Creates less contrast
* Good for images, not infographics

### Complementary

* Uses two colors directly oposite on the color wheel
* High contrast
* One color is primary, the other for accents
* Good for charts, graphs, important points

### Split Commentary

* Uses one dominant color plus the two adjacent to the complement of the dominant
* Hard to balance

### Triadic

* High contrast
* Overpowering when using the same saturation for all colors
* Good for charts

### Square

* Four equidistant colors
* High contrast
* Pick a dominant color

### Rectangle

* A.K.A. Tetradic
* 


### How to choose a scheme
1. UX (functionality)
2. Mood (goal oriented)
3. Context (background)
4. Background and color overlap
5. 60-30-10 Rule (Main color, secondary, accent)
